# Homepage Reference Documentation Package

Reference site: https://onlyscrews.in/ (inspected 2026-10-21)
Target project: VERTEX E-Commerce, https://github.com/adarshbetha-tech/Hv--ecommerce- (commit b41f6fa; partially audited, see 07)

## Purpose
Evidence-based documentation so a developer or coding agent can recreate the reference homepage's layout and behavior in VERTEX without having seen the original conversation. **No code has been written or modified.**

## Evidence level (read first)
Inspection was done by a text/markdown page fetch only. There was no rendered browser, no screenshots, no computed CSS, no JS inspection and no viewport testing. Therefore:
- Section order, text structure, link destinations, prices and image URLs are **Observed**.
- Anything about colors, fonts, spacing, animation, breakpoints and hover behavior is **Unknown** unless labeled **Estimated** or **Proposed**.
- Tags used everywhere: `[OBSERVED]`, `[INFERRED]`, `[ESTIMATED]`, `[PROPOSED]`, `[UNKNOWN]`.

## How to use
1. Read 10 first to see what is not yet known.
2. Supply the missing evidence (screenshots/recording, VERTEX repo, DevTools computed styles).
3. Re-run inspection to upgrade `[UNKNOWN]`/`[ESTIMATED]` items, then complete 07.
4. Only then implement per 08 and verify per 09.

## Evidence to check before implementation
- Screenshots at ~1440, ~820, ~390 px widths for every section.
- DevTools computed styles (fonts, colors, spacing) and the theme's CSS/JS file list.
- Remaining VERTEX files not yet read (see 07 "Still unverified"), and a baseline `npm test` / `npm run build` run.
- Legal clearance for any reused imagery, logos and copy (see 06).
